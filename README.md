## _About Cucumber_
Cucumber is a behavior-driven development (BDD) tool that helps teams define, document, and automate their software requirements.\
It uses natural language to describe the behavior of a software application and enables developers, testers, 
and business stakeholders to collaborate and create tests that can be automated.
Cucumber supports various programming languages, including Java, Ruby, and Python, and integrates with various testing frameworks, such as JUnit, TestNG, and RSpec.
